TODO list for PEPAto at 03/11/2006 
Author Mirco Tribastone --mtribast
-- 
Parsing and state space derivation error handling within Eclipse.
--
Make names of the AST API coherent (setProcess, setTarget, setNode
generate a lot of confusion)
--
Make method names of the AST Factory coherent (the rule should be
xxxNode createXXX)
--
Implement a method which validates strings passed to AST nodes to name
rate or processes (currently only null check performed)
--
Create example of infinite state space derivation
--
Actions, Process definitions and rate definitions are not so consistent
with the API. They should simply be multi-valued properties
--
Important modification to the API: provide nodes with getter methods.
Put setter methods elsewhere (JDT pattern). What does that impact on?
