	This package is concerned with steady-state analysis of PEPA models whose 
	underlying representation is a Continous Time Markov Chain (CTMC).
<p>
	Solvers all share the same interface <code>ISolver</code>, whose instances
	are obtained via the factory <code>SolverFactory</code>. ISolver is
	also responsible for the knowledge of the currently available solvers, which
	are listed as ISolver's public constants.
<p>
	Solver implementations are taken from LGPL-based libraries such as 
	MTJ - Matrix Toolkit for Java. Necessary classes for library bridging
	and adapting are available descending the <code>ctmc</code> 
	package hierarchy: For example, MTJ adaptation is available 
	in <code>uk.ac.ed.inf.pepa.ctmc.solution.mtj</code>
