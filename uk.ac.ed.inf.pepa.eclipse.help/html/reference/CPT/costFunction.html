<h1>Cost Function</h1>

		<p>
			Each particle in a PSO search evaluates a model configuration using a cost function. The cost function is the summation of the 
			weighted <b>population cost</b> and the 
			weighted <b>performance cost</b>.
			The weights provide some tuning, the designer can use the weights to determine the importance of each cost in the search.
		</p>
		<p>
			The summation and weights work as follows:

<h3>Population cost</h3>
			<center><img src="../../gettingstarted/capacityplanning/img/CPTPopulationCost.png"></center>
		<p>
			Population cost is the weighted sum of the population size of each component in that model configuration.
		</p>
		
<h3>Performance cost</h3>

		<p>
			Performance cost is dependent on the selection of performance measure. In either case the PSO is looking to reduce the cost as much as possible.
			<b>Target</b> is the threshold or target performance the designer is looking for. <b>Measured</b> is performance measure of the evaluated model configuration.
