		<h3>Time Series Analysis</h3>
		<p>
			Time series analysis can be carried out on a PEPA model via two
			different techniques: ODE and SSA. The former is the result of the
			mapping of a PEPA model to a set of Ordinary Differential Equation,
			the latter runs Stochastic Simulation Algorithms on a PEPA model.
			These functionalities are available under the 
			<b>PEPA > Time Series Analysis</b> menu and they share parts of the
			user interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			To perform ODE analysis, click <b>PEPA > Time Series Analysis > ODE...</b>.
			You will be provided with a dialog box for configuring the ODE solver.
			On the left hand side you are required to check the components you 
			want to investigate. The time series of each component will be shown
			as a different line on the 2D graph for this analysis. On the right
			hand side you are asked to select the ODE solver and set its main
			parameters (start time, stop time, step and tolerance). Output
			options are available to export the data model to disk. The wizard
			also let you save the intermediate CMDL file, which is the format
			used by the underlying library featuring the ODE solvers.
		</p>
		<p>
			To perform SSA analysis, click <b>PEPA > Time Series Analysis > SSA...</b>.
			You will be provided with a similar dialog box to the ODE one. An
			important SSA-related parameter to set here is the number of 
			replications used during the simulation.
