		<h3>Steady-State Analysis</h3>
		<p>
			To obtain the steady-state probability distribution of the
			underlying Markov chain of a PEPA model, click 
			<b>PEPA > CTMC > Steady State Analysis</b>. The item is not
			be enabled if the state space is not derived.

			The wizard will guide you through the process of selecting a
			solver and setting its parameters. You can choose between a 
			direct solver and a range of iterative solvers for which a 
			number of preconditioners is available.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the model is solved, the State Space View will be updated 
			with a column showing the steady-state probability of each 
			column.

			out automatically and results will be available in the 
			Performance Evaluation View.
