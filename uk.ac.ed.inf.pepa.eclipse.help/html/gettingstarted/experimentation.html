		<h3>Experimentation</h3>
		<p>
			The plugin features support for experimentation, i.e. running a model
			with values for its parameters varying across desired ranges. The
			results of the experiment are plotted in the Graph View and a number
			of exporters is available for data serialisation.
		</p>
		<p>
			To launch the experimentation wizard on the model of the active
			PEPA editor, select <b>PEPA > CTMC > Experimentation...</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The first page of the wizard lists the model parameters on which 
			experimentation can be run. This will include the rate definitions
			as well as all the aggregation operators included in the model 
			system equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			After <b>Next</b> is pressed, a wizard page for each selected 
			parameter will let the user set the desidered range to be used in 
			the experiments. Range can be specified in two different ways. For 
			a uniform sampling over a given interval you may want to click the 
			<b>Specify an interval</b> button. Otherwise, a comma separated
			list of values can be directly specified if the 
			<b>Specify comma-separated list</b> is pressed.
		</p>

		<p>
			The last page of the wizard lets you create the experiments with
			the specified parameters. The plugin currently supports two types
			of experiments. A basic 2D graph plotting a performance metric 
			against a parameter. A parametrised 2D graph plots a number of lines
			a performance metric against a parameter, a line for each
			value in the desired range of a second parameter.
		</p>
		<img src="img/experimentpage.png">
		<p>
			The performance metrics available are: action throughput, sequential
			state utilisation, or steady-state probability of a subset of the
			state space as specified by a filter in the filter rule editor of the
			model.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a new experiment for a basic 2D graph, right click the 
			list-box on the left of the wizard page and select 
			<b>New > XYPlot</b>. The right hand side of the page will be 
			dinamically updated with the widgetry for defining the experiment.
		</p>
		<img src="img/basicxyplot.png">
		<p> 
			The name of the experiment will be shown as the title of the
			generated graph. The X Axis combo box lists the available model
			parameters and selection on the performance metric combo box 
			will update the user interface with an additional section related
			to that performance metric. In the case of throughput, for example,
			a combo box lets the user select the action type.
		</p>

		<p>
			To create a new experiment for a parametrised 2D graph, 
			right click the list-box on the left of the wizard page and select 
			<b>New > Parametrised XYPlot</b>. The user interface is very similar
			to that of the basic 2D graph, except for an additional combo box
			requiring the user to specify the second parameter.
		</p>

		<p>
			To delete an experiment, right-click the experiment on the list box and
			select <b>Delete</b>
		<p>
			When you are done setting up the experiments, you can run them by
			pressing the <b>Finish</b> button of the wizard. The experiments will
			be run in the background and the results will be shown in the
			Graph View.
