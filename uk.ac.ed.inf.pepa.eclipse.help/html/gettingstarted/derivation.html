		<h3>State Space Derivation</h3>
		<p>
			Once a model is successfully parsed, Markovian analysis can begin
			via state space derivation of the underlying Markov chain.
		</p>
		<p>
			To derive the state space of the model in the active editor in the 
			workbench, select <b>PEPA > CTMC > Derive</b>.
		</p>
			A tabular representation of the derived state space is shown in
			the State Space View
