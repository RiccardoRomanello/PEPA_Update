		<h3>Single Step Navigator</h3>
		<p>
			The Single Step Navigator is tool for walking the state
			space graphically. It is particularly useful for debugging 
			purposes. It consists of two tables containing the list
			of incoming and outgoing states. The sequential 
			components which cause the transition to be performed 
			are highlighted and an option allows you to make 
			filtered states not walkable.
		</p>
		<p>
			To open the navigator, right click a state in the state
			space view and select <b>Single Step Navigator</b>. The
			tool will be shown in a separate dialog box.
