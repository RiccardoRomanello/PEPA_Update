		<h3>Exporting the State Space</h3>
		<p>
			The State Space View provides a wizard to export
			the state space into a csv (comma-separated values)
			files. To open the wizard, click the export button
			in the top right corner of the state space view.

			The wizard will produce two files, the generator
			matrix and the state space in the form of an ordered
			list of strings. The separator character will be used
			to delimit the values in the generator matrix files.
			If the <b>Include state number</b> option is checked,
			the state number will be prepended to state. The state
			can be represented fully or as an array of separated
			top level components. Moreover, if the steady-state solution is
			available, the steady state probability can be included in
			the state space file. The values of the state space files
			will be delimited using the separator character of the
			generator matrix.
		</p>
		<p>
			Click <b>Next</b> to select the destination for the target
			files. The wizard doesn't allow to overwrite existing files.
