			The plugin provides an editor for PEPA model input files. The editor contributes
			a top-level menu item to the workbench bar through which all the PEPA-related
			tools are accessible. Additional information is provided via workbench views. The
			PEPA perspective provides a customisable layout for those views in the workbench.

		<p>
			To open the PEPA Perspective, select <b>Window > Open Perspective > Other</b>.
			Then select <b>PEPA</b> and press <b>OK</b> to finish.
