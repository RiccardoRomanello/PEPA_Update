		<h3>State Space View</h3>
		<p>
			The State Space View allows you to navigate the underlying CTMC
			of a PEPA model. After a model is derived, the view presents a 
			tabular representation of the state space. The first column 
			shows the state number, then there are as many columns as the 
			number of top-level components. An additional column shows 
			the steady-state probability of the state after the model is solved.
