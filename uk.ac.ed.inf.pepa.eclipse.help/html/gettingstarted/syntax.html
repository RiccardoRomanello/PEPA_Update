		<h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Rate Assignments</b> must precede any process definition. 
			A rate identifier is valid if it is a valid Java
			identifier starting with a lowercase letter. Rate assignments
			support expressions. They must end with a semicolon
			<pre>
				r1 = 1.0;
				r2 = 2.0 * r1 - 0.05;
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Process Assignments</b> A process identifier is valid if it is 
			a valid Java identifier starting with an uppercase letter. As usual
			an identifier can represent a Choice or a Prefix. It can also identify
			subparts of the system when it is assigned a cooperation. Process
			assignments must end with a semicolon
			<pre>
				P1 = (a, r1).P1 + (b, r2).P1;
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Passive Rates</b> can be specified as either <code>infty</code> or 
			<code>T</code>. Weights can be assigned as integer numbers. Weights however
			cannot be rate identifiers. If no weight is specified, the default value
			<code>1</code> is assumed.
			<pre>
				(a, T).P
				(b, infty).P
				(a, 3 * infty).P
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Cooperation Sets</b> are enclosed by . Cooperations with empty action set
			can be alternately specified with the parallel operation <code>||</code>.
			<pre>
				P <a,b,c> Q
				P || P
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Aggregation</b> is partially supported by the plugin. If a cooperation on an empty 
			action set between <code>n</code> is declared as <code>P[n]</code> then a canonical
			form representation for the process is considered during state space derivation
			of the underlying Markov chain.
