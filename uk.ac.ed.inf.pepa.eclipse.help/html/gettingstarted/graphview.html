		<h3>Graph View</h3>
		<p>
			The Graph View is a tab-based view responsible for the management 
			of all the graphs produced by the PEPA plugin. It is automatically
			opened when a new graph is requested. If you want to open it 
			explicitely, select <b>Window > Show View > Other...</b> and
			then select <b>PEPA > Graph View</b>. The view support tools for
			editing graph properties such as background color, line thickness
			and legends. In addition, it provides a number of exporters to save
			the image to graphic formats such as PNG or serialise the data to 
			file.
