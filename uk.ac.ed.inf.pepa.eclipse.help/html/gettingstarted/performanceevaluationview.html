		<h3>Performance Evaluation View</h3>
		<p>
			The Performance Evaluation View shows information about
			throughput and utilisation analysis. The view is automatically
			updated when the model in the active editor is solved.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>Throughput Analysis</b> tab lists the rate at which the 
			actions of the PEPA model are performed at steady-state. A bar
			plot can be obtained by right-click the list and selecting
			<b>Show graph</b>. The corresponding graph will be shown in 
			the Graph View.

			The <b>Utilisation Analysis</b> tab is a tree-based view showing 
			the long-run utilisation of each top-level component of the model.
			For each component, it shows the percentage of time it is in a
			particular local state. A pie chart of a component can be 
			obtained by right-clicking the desired component in the tree and
			selecting <b>Show graph</b>. The corresponding graph will be shown 
			in the Graph View.
