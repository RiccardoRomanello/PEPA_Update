		<p>
		The above is a screen shot of the fourth page of the CPT wizard. In this page you are setting the threshold or target performance.
		The weightings are used to provide fine tuning of the performance measures. The weighting is proportional: 
		<br> Performance_Weight_i = Performance_Weight_i / (Sum of all performance weights) 
		<br> The penalty is additional cost added to the performance cost if the target/threshold is not met.
