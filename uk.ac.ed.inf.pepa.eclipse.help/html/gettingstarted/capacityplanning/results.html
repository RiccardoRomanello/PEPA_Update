	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p> The CPT offers three different types of result </p>

	<ol>
	<li> The Capacity Planning List/Table View
	<li> The Capacity Planning Tree View
	<li> The csv format file 
	</ol>

	<p> 
	It is possible to click and drag, or maximise the right hand View pane. In here we find the two Views. The remaining result, the .csv file, is found in the location set in the Capacity Planning Wizard. The .csv contains all model configurations seen by the search, and also the configuration information used to perform the search.
