		<p>
		The above is a screen shot of the second page of the CPT wizard. In this page you are configuring the cost function parameters:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li> Performance weight* - increasing this with respect to the population weight makes the impact of the performance deviation from its target 
		"more important" than population cost in the cost function.
		<li> Population weight* - conversely to the above, an increase in population weight makes population cost 
		"more important" in terms of influence on the cost function.
		</ol>
