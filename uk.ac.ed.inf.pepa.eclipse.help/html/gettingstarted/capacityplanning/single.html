		The above is a screen shot of the PSO options menu being highlighted in the PEPA Eclipse plug-in project.
		To start a PSO go to the PEPA menu, select <i>capacity planning</i>, <i>PSO</i> and then choose the type of performance target you would like to create.

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p> The CPT uses a PSO to search through the <b>model configuration search space</b>.
	A PSO creates a <b>population</b> of particle agents; these are seeded randomly in the search space. In each generation/iteration, 
	each particle 'moves' through the search space. A particle moves through the model configuration search space looking for an optimal 
	model configuration based on a user defined <b>cost function</b>. 
	The PSO in the CPT has six parameters: 
	
	<ol>
	<li> Experiments
	<li> Generation
	<li> Population count
	<li> Original velocity
	<li> Personal best
	<li> Global best
	</ol>

		<ol>
		<li> A PSO Lab creates a number of PSO <b>experiments</b>, each experiment is a single PSO run. 
		The model designer can define the number of experiments to run; HC and PSO are stochastic heuristics, running a number 
		of experiments increases the chance of a good outcome.
		<li> A PSO run (each experiment) seeds a number of particle agents, and moves the particles through the model configuration search space
		until either the particles converge, or the number of moves exceeds the generation count. 
		<li> Each move the particles evaluate the model configuration using the <b>cost function</b>.
		</ol>
