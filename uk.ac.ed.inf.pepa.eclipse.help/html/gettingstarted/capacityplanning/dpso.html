<h1>Driven Particle Swarm Optimisation (dPSO)</h1>

	<p>
	Not all designers will have experience in using PSOs, and therefore the user may not know how to set the PSO
	parameters for a capacity planning search. A dPSO uses a Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) to 'drive' many 
	PSO searches. The HC search has two settings, experiment count and generations. The more experiments and 
	generations that the HC search is allowed, the higher the chance of finding good solutions, but the longer 
	the search will take to return results. This is an automated heuristic and it will work on behalf 
	of the designer to find the best PSO parameters for an optimal model configuration search. It returns
	with all the model configurations evaluated, but also the PSO parameters used to find these configurations.
	This means the designer can use these PSO parameters in the future to run faster Single PSO searches.

		<li> A Hill Climbing Lab creates a number of Hill Climbing experiments, each experiment is a HC run. 
		The designer can define the number of experiments to run; HC and PSO are stochastic heuristics, running a number 
		of experiments increases the chance of a good outcome.
		<li> A Hill Climbing Algorithm (each experiment) then iterates for a user defined number of generations. Each generation is 
		a HC configured PSO Lab: We expect the HC to test for a better PSO Lab in each generation. The HC determines the parameters 
		for the PSO Lab, and then starts the PSO Lab experiments.
		<li> A PSO Lab returns with the model configurations found by its underlying PSO.
