	<h3>Capacity planning</h3>
		<p>
			Real systems are expected to service some <b>demand</b> with good <b>performance</b>. For example, a cloud based web-service
			may have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This SLA might stipulate that the web-service will have a number of clients
			when operating (service demand) and must respond to all client requests within a certain time (performance).
		</p>
		<p>
			Real systems are usually complex systems, consisting of <b>compositions of resources</b>. A naive approach to satisfying the SLA would be to 
			continue adding resources to the system until the system meets the performance requirement. We want to avoid <b>over-provisioning</b>,
			where we have under-used resources, because these add to our operational cost unnecessarily. We want to avoid <b>under-provisioning</b>,
			as this means our system is not going to meet the SLA.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want an <b>optimum configuration</b> of resources, a configuration that uses the fewest number of resources, but still meets
			the expected service demand with a good performance. Searching for optimal configurations is time consuming and difficult. The CPT
			is an automated tool designed to aid the modeller in finding an optimal confguration, and in gaining some insight into the systems' behaviour 
			when we consider the number of resources as a parameter.

		<h3>This guide</h3>
		<p>
			This guide provides a step-by-step description of the <b>Capacity Planning Tool</b> (CPT).
		</p>
		<p>
			It shows how to configure the tool in order to search for some <b> optimal model configuration</b> of system components. This page gives an
			overview of the tool in order to provide insight into how the tool works, and therefore how to configure the tool for a search. We start with
			a brief motivation, and then provide a high level view of the CPT.

		<ol>
		<li> The designer creates a PEPA model in the <a href="../editor.html">PEPA editor</a>.
		<li> Then the designer starts the CPT choosing either a <a href="driven.html">Driven Particle Swarm Optimisation (dPSO)</a> or a
			<a href="single.html">Single Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)</a> search.
		<li> The search engine then searches through the <a href="../../reference/CPT/cpt.html#modelConfigurationSearchSpace">model configuration
		search space</a>, using a <a href="../../reference/CPT/cpt.html#costFunction">cost function</a> to evaluate each model configuration.
		<li> The CPT passes a <a href="treeView.html">tree view</a> of the results, with the model configuration with the least cost at the top.
		<li> The CPT also passes a <a href="listView.html">list view</a> of the results, sorted in ascending cost.
		</ol>
		
		<center><h4>Performance evaluation</h4></center>
		
		The CPT can evaluate models in terms of:
		
		<ol>
		<li> Capacity Utilisation
		<li> Population levels
		<li> Throughput
		<li> Average Response-Time
		</ol>
		
				<center><h4>The search algorithm (in brief)</h4></center>
		<p>		
		The CPT uses <a href="../../reference/CPT/cpt.html#pso">Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)</a> to search through a model configuration search 
		space. The PSO creates a population of particles. This population then moves through the model configuration search space a number of times seeking an 
		optimal configuration. 
		</p>
		<p>		
		Particles have a value derived from the corresponding model configuration using a <a href="../../reference/CPT/cpt.html#costFunction">cost function</a>. The parameters of the cost function will have been defined by the designer.
		Therefore the meaning of optimal, in terms of a model configuration, will be dependent on the user-defined cost function.  
		</p>
		<p>
		In a dPSO the CPT uses a Hill Climbing algorithm in order to find the best PSO settings for a model configuration search.
