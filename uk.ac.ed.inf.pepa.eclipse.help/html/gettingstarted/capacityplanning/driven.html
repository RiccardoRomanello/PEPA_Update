		The above is a screen shot of the dPSO options menu being highlighted in the PEPA Eclipse plug-in project.
		To start a dPSO go to the PEPA menu, select capacity planning, dPSO and then the type of performance you would like to evaluate.

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>
	Not all designers will have experience of using PSOs, and therefore the user may not know how to set the PSO
	parameters for a capacity planning search. A dPSO uses a Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) to 'drive' many 
	PSO searches. The HC has two settings, experiment count and generations. The more experiments and 
	generations that the HC is allowed, the higher the chance of finding good solutions, but the longer 
	the search will take to return results. This is an automated heuristic and it will work on behalf 
	of the designer to find the best PSO parameters for an optimal model configuration search. It returns
	with all the model configurations evaluated, but also the PSO parameters used to find these configurations.
	This means the designer can use these PSO parameters in the future to run faster Single PSO searches.

		<li> A Hill Climbing Lab creates a number of Hill Climbing experiments, each experiment is an HC	run. 
		The designer can define the number of experiments to run; HC and PSO are stochastic heuristics, running a number 
		of experiments increases the chance of a good outcome.
		<li> A Hill Climbing Algorithm (each experiment) then iterates for a user-defined number of generations. Each generation is 
		a HC search to configure the six parameters needed to create a PSO Lab: We expect the HC search to test for a better PSO Lab each generation. 
		The HC determines the parameters for the PSO Lab, and then starts the PSO Lab experiments.
		<li> A PSO Lab returns with the model configurations found by its underlying PSO.
