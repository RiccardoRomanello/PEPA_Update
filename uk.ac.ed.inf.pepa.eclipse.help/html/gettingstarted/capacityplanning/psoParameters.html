<h1>PSO parameters</h1>

<h3>Particle velocity</h3>
	<p>
	
	Each particle has a velocity. Every iteration the velocity is affected by three parameters:
	
	<ol>
	<li> <b> Original velocity weight
	<li> Personal best weight
	<li> Global best weight </b>
	</ol>
	
	Below we describe how a new particle position is calculated, how a particle moves through the search space:

	</p>
	
<h3>Population count</h3>
	<p>
	The number of particle agents used to search in the model configurations search space.
	</p>
	
<h3>Generations</h3>
	<p>
	The number of iterations over which the meta heuristic will be run. For the HC, this is the number of mutations the algorithm will try; for the
	PSO, this is the maximum number of particle moves that will be attempted.
	</p>
	
<h3>Experiments</h3>

	<p>
	A Lab runs a number of '<i>experiments</i>'. An experiment is a new seeding (start position/parameter configuration) of a PSO Lab or 
	particle population in the model configuration search space. They are called experiments because we are testing to 
	see if this seeding will yeild better results. Experiments are useful as they increase the chance of finding an optimal result. 
	Setting up experiments saves the model designer from needing to repeat PSO or HC runs. 
	</p>
<p>
The following three values give the weight or importance to be given to certain characteristics of a particle at the end of a move when its velocity for the next move is calculated.</p> 
	
<h3>Original velocity</h3>
	<p>
	This is the velocity of the particle on the previous move. Setting this weight higher makes the particle 'heavier', and less
	likely to change course.
	</p>
	
<h3>Personal best</h3>
	<p>
	As a particle moves through the search space it will find its own personal best model configuration, or position, in the search space. 
	Giving more weight to the personal best makes the particle more attracted to its own findings than those of other particles. Setting this higher
	than other weights could lead to the particles never converging; as they each prefer their own locations.
	</p>
	
<h3>Global best</h3>
	<p>
	As the PSO iterates it will find a global best position --- the best position found by the PSO (by any particle, in any generation) so far. 
	This weight determines how much a particle will be attracted to the global best position. Setting this weight too high could make the PSO
	converge too early as the particles will be strongly attracted to the best position.
